## 📋 Pre-Demo Checklist

### Before the Demo
- [ ] Build published EXE: `dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true`
- [ ] Verify documents exist in `bulk_generated_documents_all_formats` folder
- [ ] Check `appsettings.json` arrival rate (default: 6 casos/minuto)
- [ ] Close any running instances
- [ ] Test internet connection (not required, but good for confidence)
- [ ] Have backup plan: Screenshots if live demo fails

### Demo Environment Setup
```
C:\SiaraDemo\
├── Siara.Simulator.exe

## 🚀 Running the Demo

### Step 1: Start the Simulator
```bash
cd C:\SiaraDemo
Siara.Simulator.exe
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[15:30:00 INF] CaseService created with DocumentSourcePath: ...
[15:30:00 INF] Initial arrival rate: 6.0 cases/minute
Now listening on: https://localhost:5002
```

### Step 2: Open Browser
Navigate to: `https://localhost:5002`

### Step 3: Login
- **Username:** Any text (e.g., "demo", "banejemplo")
- **Password:** Any text (e.g., "demo", "password")
- **Note:** Authentication is cosmetic for demo purposes

### Step 4: Dashboard
You'll see:
- 🎨 Animated particles background (gold on green)
- 📊 Empty dashboard (waiting for first case)
- 🎛️ Arrival rate slider

## 🎬 Demo Script (5-7 Minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)
> "Welcome to the SIARA simulator. Since we cannot legally access the actual CNBV authority request system, we've built this simulator that replicates real-world case arrivals from government agencies."

**Show:** Government branding, professional UI

### Problem Statement (1 minute)
> "Financial institutions receive legal requests from CNBV through the SIARA system. These requests—called 'oficios'—require urgent compliance: account freezes, information requests, documentation."
>
> "Processing these manually is slow, error-prone, and risky. Missing a deadline can result in regulatory penalties."

**Show:** Wait for first case to arrive (usually 5-30 seconds with 6 casos/minuto)

### Case Arrival (1 minute)
> "Watch—a new case just arrived! This is a real document from our test corpus."
>
> "Notice the Folio SIARA ID—this is the government tracking number. Each case includes PDF, DOCX, and XML versions of the official document."

**Show:**
- Case appears in real-time
- Click PDF/DOCX/XML buttons to show documents
- Highlight fecha de llegada (arrival timestamp)

### Configurability (1 minute)
> "For this demo, we're running at 6 cases per minute—that's 360 cases per hour. But watch what happens when we simulate peak load..."

**Show:**
- Drag slider to 30-60 casos/minuto
- Watch cases flood in
- Demonstrate system handles high volume

**Reset:** Drag back to 6 casos/minuto

### Real-World Application (2 minutes)
> "In production, our Prisma processor sits behind this simulator. It:
> 1. Receives each case in real-time
> 2. Extracts structured data using AI (GOT-OCR2)
> 3. Classifies the request type (EMBARGO, DESEMBARGO, etc.)
> 4. Routes to appropriate compliance workflow
> 5. Generates response within regulatory SLA"

**Show (if integrated):**
- Case status changes
- Processing metrics
- Generated compliance reports

### Value Proposition (1 minute)
> "Benefits for your institution:
> - ⚡ **Faster:** Process requests in seconds, not hours
> - ✅ **Accurate:** AI extraction eliminates manual errors
> - 📊 **Compliant:** Automated audit trail for regulators
> - 💰 **Cost Savings:** Reduce manual processing by 90%"

### Questions (Remaining time)
Common questions:
- **Q:** "Can it handle our document formats?"
  **A:** "Yes—PDF, DOCX, XML, even scanned images with OCR."

- **Q:** "What about security/compliance?"
  **A:** "All processing is on-premises. No data leaves your network."

- **Q:** "Integration with our systems?"
  **A:** "REST API, database connectors, or file-based integration—whatever you prefer."

## 🎛️ Demo Configuration Tricks

### For Different Scenarios

**Conservative Demo (Safe):**
```json
"AverageArrivalsPerMinute": 3.0
```
Slower arrival rate, more time to talk

**Impressive Demo (High Energy):**
```json
"AverageArrivalsPerMinute": 20.0
```
Cases flood in, shows system can handle volume

**Stress Test Demo:**
```json
"AverageArrivalsPerMinute": 60.0
```
Maximum arrival rate, proves scalability

**Reset Between Demos:**
```json
"ResetCasesOnStartup": true
```
Start fresh every time

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting During Demo

### Issue: No Cases Appearing
**Cause:** Documents folder missing
**Fix:** Check `DocumentSourcePath` in appsettings.json

### Issue: Particles Not Loading
**Cause:** JS interop timing
**Fix:** Refresh browser (F5), particles.js will load

### Issue: Port Already in Use
**Cause:** Previous instance still running
**Fix:** Kill process, restart

### Issue: Browser Shows "Connection Lost"
**Cause:** Blazor circuit timeout
**Fix:** Refresh browser, should reconnect

### Performance
- **Arrival Rate:** 0.1 to 60 cases/minute (configurable)
- **Processing Time:** <2 seconds per case (with Prisma)
- **Accuracy:** 99%+ data extraction
- **Uptime:** 24/7 availability

### Business Impact
- **Manual Processing:** 10-15 minutes per case
